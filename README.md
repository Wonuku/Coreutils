# Coreutils
Recreation some of core utilities that is expected to be found at every Unixlike system they are all compiled under Linux but they should work with other unixlike systems with little to no modification.

# Status
Ls and rm works however rm sometimes has problems dealing with nested directories. I got bored while writing mv and quit halfway through.

# TODO
1. Complete mv
2. Fix rm
~~3. Create cat~~
4. Create touch
5. Create cp
6. Give ls prettier printing
7. Create a shell
